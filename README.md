## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit your content in `assets/js/projects.js`. Each project has:
   - `id`, `title`, `role`, `year`, `cover`, `tags`, `summary`, `body[]`, `links[]`.
3. Thumbnails are pulled from `assets/img/*`. You can drop your own images there.
4. Clicking a project opens `project.html?id=...` which renders the full case study and includes a back button.
5. Colors and theme are in `assets/css/styles.css` (CSS variables at the top).
